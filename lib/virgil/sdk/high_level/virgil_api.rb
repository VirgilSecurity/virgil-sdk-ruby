      # The VirgilApi class is a high-level API that provides easy access to
      # Virgil Security services and allows to perform cryptographic operations by using two domain entities
      # VirgilKey and VirgilCard. Where the VirgilKey is an entity
      # that represents a user's Private key, and the VirgilCard is the entity that represents
      # user's identity and a Public key.
